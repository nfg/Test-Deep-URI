=head1 NAME

Test::Deep::URI - Easier testing of URIs for Test::Deep

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::Deep;
  use Test::Deep::URI;

  $testing_url = "http://site.com/path?a=1&b=2";
  cmp_deeply(
    $testing_url,
    all(
      uri("http://site.com/path?a=1&b=2"),
      # or
      uri("//site.com/path?a=1&b=2"),
      # or
      uri("/path?b=2&a=1"),
    )
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Deep::URI provides the function C<uri($expected)> for L<Test::Deep>.
Use it in combination with C<cmp_deeply> to test against partial URIs.

In particular I wrote this because I was tired of stumbling across unit
tests that failed because C<http://site.com/?foo=1&bar=2> didn't match
C<http://site.com/?bar=2&foo=1>. This helper is smart enough to compare
query_form parameters separately, while still enforcing the order of values
for duplicate parameters.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item uri($expected)

Exported by default.

I<$expected> should be a string that can be passed to C<URI->new()>.

=back

=head1 ERRATA

I've mostly been using this with URLs, but it's built around L<URI>
and should work with all types. Let me know if something doesn't work.
